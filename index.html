    <h1>Welcome to a Revamped CUNYFirst Search Function User Interface and student journal entry website!</h1>
    <p>How to use this website</p>
    <p> 1. Navigate through all the different webpages using the Navigation bar location in the middle of the screen
        near the top on all pages.</p>
    <p> 2. To use the search function input the needed information into the specific fields and then click the buttons
        to allow yourself to add to a list which shows your recent searches.</p>
    <p> 3. To use the add classes function you will see a list of class you have added from the search function and
        confirm those classses to add</p>

    <p>About us:</p>
    <p> The creators of the website: Francis Rigor, Wosen Yu, Simon Hsia, Deeon st. Jean</p>
    <p>We are four computer science majors attending CUNY Brooklyn college and this website was created as the
        requirements
        of a project for the course CISC 3650
    </p>

    <p>Reasons for design choices of this website:</p>
    <p>The search function was meant to be created as a better User Interface for students in CUNY to use in terms of
        searching
        for classes and adding classes
    </p>
    <p>The creation of the journal page was for students to be allowed to have a way to write whatever they would like
        to encourage them to have a way to
        write something important they would need to do, complaints about their day or whatever they would like.
